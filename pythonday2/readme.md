# Python Learning

## Synopsis

This document outlines my journey through learning and implementing various Python concepts and algorithms. The process involved exploring basic to advanced topics with the aid of documentation and interactive tools like Stackoverflow , llama , w3schools , Copilot etc...

## Topics Explored

### 1. String Manipulation
- **Key Takeaways**: Mastered string operations including slicing, concatenation, substring search, and built-in string methods.
- **Learning Method**: Engaged with Python documentation and reinforced learning through practical examples.

### 2. Functions
- **Key Takeaways**: Learned to define and invoke functions, utilize parameters and return values, and create lambda functions.
- **Learning Method**: Followed tutorials and practiced through examples provided in the Python documentation.

### 3. Tuples
- **Key Takeaways**: Gained understanding of creating tuples, accessing their elements, their immutability, and tuple unpacking.
- **Learning Method**: Studied the official Python documentation and experimented with code snippets.

### 4. Dictionaries
- **Key Takeaways**: Learned to create dictionaries, access and modify their values, and use various dictionary methods.
- **Learning Method**: Consulted Python documentation and implemented multiple examples to practice.

### 5. Sets
- **Key Takeaways**: Understood how to create sets, perform set operations (union, intersection, difference), and use set methods.
- **Learning Method**: Reviewed Python documentation and completed related exercises.

### 6. Algorithms
- **Key Takeaways**: Implemented fundamental algorithms including sorting, searching, and basic numerical methods.
- **Learning Method**: Practiced with coding exercises and referenced documentation for deeper understanding.

### 7. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
